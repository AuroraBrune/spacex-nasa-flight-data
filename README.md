---> User Story <---

As a user interested in space exploration, I am looking for an application that will show me 
comparisons and contrasts of NASA and SpaceX in real-time.

Using the application, I hope to find the following information:
1. A brief history of NASA and it development into space exploration
2. A brief history of SpaceX and its development into space exploration
3. A search feature that is interactive allowing the user to select years, test launches or missions and display return data into columns,
   one for NASA and one for SpaceX
4. Incorporate drop-down menus for year and option of search
5. A page that will discuss future plans for explorations for each company

As a user:
1. On page load a brief description of the project and navigation instructions
2. When I click on NASA tab I want to see a brief introduction with a link to the NASA website or history of the institution
3. When I click on the SpaceX tab I want to see a brief introduction with a link to the SpaceX website or history of the institution
4. When I click on the data tab I want to see drop-down menus showing options for years of launches, test launches, or missions
5. When the data is displayed, historical weather data, altitude, durations of flight pulling information from the OpenWeather API, NASA API and the SpaceX API
